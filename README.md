# TrendingPulse - Automated Lifestyle & Gossip Website

This is a fully automated, static website generated by Antigravity. It uses the Groq API to fetch/generate trending lifestyle and gossip news for USA/UK audiences and integrates Monetag direct ads.

## Features
- **Auto-Generated Content**: Uses Groq `llama3-70b-8192` (via standard API) to create spicy headlines and full articles.
- **Dynamic Images**: Automatically fetches relevant images using Pollinations AI.
- **Monetag Integration**: Direct ad links are embedded in the navbar, sidebar, feed, and articles.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with TailwindCSS for a premium mobile and desktop experience.
- **No Backend Required**: Runs entirely in the browser (Client-side JS).

## Setup & Hosting on GitHub Pages

1. **Initialize Git**:
   Open a terminal in this folder and run:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - TrendingPulse Automated Site"
   ```

2. **Create GitHub Repository**:
   - Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository (e.g., `trending-pulse`).
   - Do **not** initialize with README/license (keep it empty).

3. **Push to GitHub**:
   Copy the commands provided by GitHub, which will look like:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/trending-pulse.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your repository **Settings** > **Pages**.
   - Under "Source", select `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder.
   - Click **Save**.
   - Your site will be live at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/trending-pulse/`.

## customization
- **API Key**: The Groq API key is currently hardcoded in `assets/js/app.js`. 
  > **Warning**: effectively exposing your key to anyone who views the source code. For a production site, consider using a proxy or serverless function (Netlify functions / Cloudflare Workers) to hide the key.
- **Ad Link**: Change the `MONETAG_LINK` variable in `assets/js/app.js` to update your ad destination.
